          I'm a full-stack developer based out of Toronto, Ontario. I specialize
          in front-end development and have a passion for making user-end
          applications that perform fast and look amazing. When VSCode is closed
          I am stacking I blocks in Tetris, giving myself carpal tunnel through
          rhythm games or spending too much time making my Minecraft house look
          like my dream home.
